# Security Policy

VRAXION is a research repository. Security is still taken seriously, but expectations should match the scope.

## Reporting a vulnerability

If you believe you have found a security vulnerability:

1) Prefer a private report via GitHub Security Advisories:
   https://github.com/VRAXION/VRAXION/security/advisories/new
2) If you cannot use advisories, open a GitHub Discussion and clearly mark it as a security concern.

Please include:

- A clear description of the issue
- Steps to reproduce
- Impact assessment (what could an attacker do?)
- Any mitigations or patches you propose

## In scope

- Vulnerabilities that affect users running VRAXION tooling or published artifacts.

## Out of scope

- Issues that require secrecy for public-source code (anything public can be cloned).
- Attacks requiring full local machine compromise.

## Supported versions

This repo is under active development. Only `main` is considered supported.
