# Session Rules (must follow every task)

1) Every reply includes a multi-step plan.
2) Step 1 always verifies prerequisites: cross-check required files/settings; assume nothing.
3) Final step delivers exactly what was requested, in the required location/format.
4) If blocked, stop only to ask for the specific missing info after checking logs/files/structure to see if it can be derived without asking.
5) Keep iterating creatively until the final step is achieved; no partial-success stopping.
